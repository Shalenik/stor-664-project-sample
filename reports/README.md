## Expectations
- Each section file should be uploaded to Gradescope for grading. 

### 01_introduction.md
- Clearly state what question you are trying to answer.  
- Explain why the question is important.  
- Summarize any existing relevant literature.  
- Describe what data you will use.  
- Keep this section conceptual — there should be no or minimal math.

---

### 02_methods.md
- Explain how you will answer your question.  
- Describe what models you will fit and why they are appropriate.  
- State your assumptions and how you will check them.  
- Define your null hypothesis(es)  
- It is acceptable to include equations or math but they must be well explained  
- Note whether your analysis will be adaptive (e.g., involve model selection).  
- Describe how you will account for multiple comparisons if relevant.

---

### 03_results.md
- Present the results of applying your methods.  
- Include appropriate figures and/or tables to illustrate findings.  
- Focus on reporting outcomes not interpretation — save discussion for the next section.

---

### 04_discussion.md
- Summarize what you learned about your original question.  
- Discuss whether your answer was conclusive and if not, what could make it so (e.g., more data, better methods).  
- Reflect on limitations of your data and analyses.  
- Evaluate whether your assumptions were reasonable  
- Suggest directions for future work based on your findings.  
- Add an abstract at the beginning of the final report summarizing the overall study.
